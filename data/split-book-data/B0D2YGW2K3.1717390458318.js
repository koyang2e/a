window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the third book in the Mystwick School of Musicraft series, Amelia Jones and her friends fall centuries into the past, and their only hope may lie in the hands of the villain they fear most....</p> <p>After defeating the terrifying Necromuse and his mysterious orchestra, all Amelia Jones hopes for is a return to normal. But to her surprise, her class is sent to Europe for a month of study abroad. This seems like the perfect escape from all her problems, but not long after they land in Salzburg, Austria, danger haunts their steps. A street musician claims there is something wrong with Amelia’s magic, odd visions of the past appear around the city, and Amelia finds a strange message preserved in a museum—a message she fears was left by the Necromuse.</p> <p>He’s still out there, and he’s still after Amelia.</p> <p>When a storm of time magic traps Amelia, Jai, and Darby in the year 1765, they join forces with the most powerful musicians of the 18th century in an attempt to restore the timeline before it rips apart entirely. But it’s not enough. With time literally breaking down around her, Amelia will have to call on music far more powerful and forbidden than anything she has attempted before...magic only the Necromuse can teach her.</p> <p>With original music throughout, this orchestral fantasy is an adventure the whole family will enjoy.</p>";
