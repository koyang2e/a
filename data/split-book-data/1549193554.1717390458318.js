window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Develop a new understanding of neurodivergence with this thoughtful exploration of the human mind from a bestselling author and psychologist.</b></p> <p>From ADHD and dyslexia to autism, the number of diagnosis categories listed by the American Psychiatric Association has tripled in the last fifty years. With so many people affected, it is time to revisit our perceptions of people with disabilities. </p> <p>Bestselling author, psychologist, and educator Thomas Armstrong illuminates a new understanding of neuropsychological disorders. He argues that if they are a part of the natural diversity of the human brain, they cannot simply be defined as illnesses. Armstrong explores the evolutionary advantages, special skills, and other positive dimensions of these conditions. </p> <p>A manifesto as well as a keenly intelligent look at \"disability,\" <i>The Power of Neurodiversity</i> is a must for parents, teachers, and anyone who is looking to learn more about neurodivergence. </p>";
