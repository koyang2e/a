window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From award-winning author Sara Pennypacker comes the long-awaited sequel to </b><b><i>Pax</i></b><b>; this is a gorgeously crafted, utterly compelling novel about chosen families and the healing power of love. A </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller!</b></p> <p>Itâ€™s been a year since Peter and his pet fox, Pax, have seen each other. Once inseparable, they now lead very different lives.</p> <p>Pax and his mate, Bristle, have welcomed a litter of kits they must protect in a dangerous world. Meanwhile Peter - newly orphaned after the war, racked with guilt and loneliness - leaves his adopted home with Vola to join the Water Warriors, a group of people determined to heal the land from the scars of the war.</p> <p>When one of Pax's kits falls desperately ill, he turns to the one human he knows he can trust. And no matter how hard Peter tries to harden his broken heart, love keeps finding a way in. Now both boy and fox find themselves on journeys toward home, healing - and each other, once again.</p> <p>As he did for <i>Pax</i>, Jon Klassen, <i>New York Times</i> best seller, Caldecott medalist, and two-time Caldecott Honoree, has created stunning jacket and interior illustrations.</p>";
