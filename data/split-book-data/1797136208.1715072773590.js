window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>She’s All That</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>What If It’s Us</i></b><b> in this N</b><b><i>ew York Time</i></b><b>s bestselling hate-to-love YA romantic comedy from the coauthor of </b><b><i>Five Feet Apart </i></b><b>Rachael Lippincott and debut writer Alyson Derrick.</b></p> <p>Alex Blackwood is a little bit headstrong, with a dash of chaos and a whole lot of flirt. She knows how to get the girl. <i>Keeping</i> her on the other hand…not so much. Molly Parker has everything in her life totally in control, except for her complete awkwardness with just about anyone besides her mom. She knows she’s in love with the impossibly cool Cora Myers. She just…hasn’t actually talked to her yet. </p> <p>Alex and Molly don’t belong on the same planet, let alone the same college campus. But when Alex, fresh off a bad (but hopefully not permanent) breakup, discovers Molly’s hidden crush as their paths cross the night before classes start, they realize they might have a common interest after all. Because maybe if Alex volunteers to help Molly learn how to get her dream girl to fall for her, she can prove to her ex that she’s not a selfish flirt. That she’s ready for an actual commitment. And while Alex is the last person Molly would ever think she could trust, she can’t deny Alex knows what she’s doing with girls, unlike her. </p> <p>As the two embark on their five-step plans to get their girls to fall for them, though, they both begin to wonder if maybe they’re the ones falling…for each other.</p>";
