But, achieving optimal shuteye and truly winding down at night are skills that few seem to have mastered.</p> <p>Aaptiv’s <i>Sleep Better</i> program includes seven classes led by meditation and mindfulness expert Jade Alexis. On day one of the program you’ll begin with ten minutes of relaxation and focus on your breath. As the week progresses you’ll graduate to a 30-minute session and incorporate techniques that train your body to release tension and prepare for deep sleep including breathwork, body scans, and yoga nidra - a type of meditative state achieved before sleep.</p> <p>This program is designed to be taken as many times through as you wish and can be referred back to as often as you need.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note: all Aaptiv audio-fitness programs, including those in your Audible library, will become unavailable after Sept 5, 2019.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
