window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p> <b>Winner of the Newbery Medal</b> </p> <p><b>“A charming, intriguingly plotted novel.” (</b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Acclaimed and award-winning author Erin Entrada Kelly’s <i>Hello, Universe</i> is a funny and poignant neighborhood story about unexpected friendships.</p> <p>Told from four intertwining points of view—two boys and two girls—the novel celebrates bravery, being different, and finding your inner <i>bayani</i> (hero). “Readers will be instantly engrossed in this relatable neighborhood adventure and its eclectic cast of misfits.”—<i>Booklist</i></p> <p>In one day, four lives weave together in unexpected ways. Virgil Salinas is shy and kindhearted and feels out of place in his crazy-about-sports family. Valencia Somerset, who is deaf, is smart, brave, and secretly lonely, and she loves everything about nature. Kaori Tanaka is a self-proclaimed psychic, whose little sister, Gen, is always following her around. And Chet Bullens wishes the weird kids would just stop being so different so he can concentrate on basketball.</p> <p>They aren’t friends, at least not until Chet pulls a prank that traps Virgil and his pet guinea pig at the bottom of a well. This disaster leads Kaori, Gen, and Valencia on an epic quest to find missing Virgil. Through luck, smarts, bravery, and a little help from the universe, a rescue is performed, a bully is put in his place, and friendship blooms. </p> <p>The acclaimed author of <i>Blackbird Fly </i>and <i>The Land of Forgotten Girls</i> writes with an authentic, humorous, and irresistible tween voice that will appeal to fans of Thanhha Lai and Rita Williams-Garcia.</p> <p><b>“Readers across the board will flock to this book that has something for nearly everyone—humor, bullying, self-acceptance, cross-generational relationships, and a smartly fateful ending.” (</b><b><i>School Library Journal</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
