window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There's no avoiding stress in life, but there's a better way to counteract it (which will also improve your sleep). In this brief educational piece, Jesse Israel, founder of The Big Quiet, shows you how meditation is the yin to stress' yang.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jesse was a successful music executive running his own label when debilitating anxiety and panic attacks forced him to step back and seek help. When he came upon meditation, it inspired him to switch gears in a big way. He founded The Big Quiet, a mass meditation movement that gathers thousands of people for large-scale moments of quiet around the world (including for Oprah’s 2020 Vision Tour with WW).&nbsp;</p> <p>This title is part of the Audible Sleep Collection, exclusive audio experiences created to invite relaxation and sleep.
