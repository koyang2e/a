window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The world's most entertaining and useless self-help guide, from the brilliant mind behind the wildly popular webcomic </b><b><i>xkcd </i></b><b>and the number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best sellers </b><b><i>What If?</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Thing Explainer</i></b></p> <p>For any task you might want to do, there's a right way, a wrong way, and a way so monumentally complex, excessive, and inadvisable that no one would ever try it. <i>How To</i> is a guide to the third kind of approach. It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole. </p> <p>Best-selling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a '90s kid by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and powering your house by destroying the fabric of space-time. And if you want to get rid of a book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapor, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the earth's mantle, or launching it into the Sun.</p> <p>By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his listeners. As he did so brilliantly in <i>What If?</i>, Munroe invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible. <i>How To</i> is a delightfully mind-bending way to better understand the science and technology underlying the things we do every day.</p>";
