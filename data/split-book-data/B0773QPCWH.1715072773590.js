window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The late Carl Rogers, founder of the humanistic psychology movement, revolutionized psychotherapy with his concept of \"client-centered therapy.\" His influence has spanned decades, but that influence has become so much a part of mainstream psychology that the ingenious nature of his work has almost been forgotten. </p> <p>With a new introduction by Peter Kramer, this landmark book is a classic in its field and a must-listen for anyone interested in clinical psychology or personal growth. </p>";
