window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A fabulously entertaining audiobook from the ultimate authority on those almost-believable tales that always happen to a \"friend of a friend\". Alligators in the sewers? A pet in the microwave? A tragic misunderstanding of the function of cruise control? No, it didn't really happen to your friend's sister's neighbor: It's an urban legend. And no matter how savvy you think you are, you are sure to find in this collection of more than 200 tales at least one story you would have sworn was true. </p><p>Jan Harold Brunvand has been collecting and studying this modern folklore for more than 20 years. In <i>Too Good to Be True</i>, he captures the best stories in their best retellings along with their latest variations and examples of how the stories have changed as they move from person to person and place to place. To help you find your favorite, Brunvand has arranged the tales thematically. \"Bringing Up Baby\" is full of episodes of child rearing gone wrong, including the grisly tale of the drugged-out babysitter who mistakes the kid for a turkey. \"Funny Business\" showcases stories of infamous lapses in customer service, such as the story of the shockingly expensive chocolate chip cookie recipe. And \"The Criminal Mind\" features both brilliant - if they were real - scams as well as the purported antics of the less mentally gifted. Whether you want to become an expert debunker or just have plenty of laughs, this audiobook will surprise and entertain you. </p>";
