window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“One of our smartest, most inventive humor writers, Ortberg combines bathos and the devotional into a revelation.” —Jordy Rosenberg, </b><b><i>The</i></b><b> </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b><br> <br> From the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Texts From Jane Eyre </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Merry Spinster</i></b><b>, writer of </b><b><i>Slate</i></b><b>’s “Dear Prudence” column, and cofounder of </b><b><i>The Toast</i></b><b> comes a hilarious and stirring collection of essays and cultural observations spanning pop culture—from the endearingly popular to the staggeringly obscure.</b><br> <br> Daniel M. Lavery is known for blending genres, forms, and sources to develop fascinating new hybrids—from lyric rants to horror recipes to pornographic scripture. In his most personal work to date, he turns his attention to the essay, offering vigorous and laugh-out-loud funny accounts of both popular and highbrow culture while mixing in meditations on gender transition, family dynamics, and the many meanings of faith.<br> <br> From a thoughtful analysis of the beauty of William Shatner to a sinister reimagining of HGTV’s <i>House Hunters</i>, and featuring figures as varied as Anne of Green Gables, Columbo, Nora Ephron, Apollo, and the cast of <i>Mean Girls</i>, <i>Something That May Shock and Discredit You</i> is a hilarious and emotionally exhilarating compendium that combines personal history with cultural history to make you see yourself and those around you entirely anew. It further establishes Lavery as one of the most innovative and engaging voices of his generation—and it may just change the way you think about Lord Byron forever.</p>";
