window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"One of the most adorable, big-hearted, charming books in existence.\" (Becky Albertalli, number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b><i>What If It's Us</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>To All the Boys I've Loved Before</i></b><b> in this upbeat and heartfelt boy-meets-boy romance that feels like a modern twist on a '90s rom-com!</b></p> <p>Everyone knows about the dare: Each week, Bryson Keller must date someone new - the first person to ask him out on Monday morning. Few think Bryson can do it. He may be the king of Fairvale Academy, but he's never really dated before.</p> <p>Until a boy asks him out, and <i>everything </i>changes.</p> <p>Kai Sheridan didn't expect Bryson to say yes. So when Bryson agrees to secretly go out with him, Kai is thrown for a loop. But as the days go by, he discovers there's more to Bryson beneath the surface, and dating him begins to feel less like an act and more like the real thing. Kai knows how the story of a gay boy liking someone straight ends. With his heart on the line, he's awkwardly trying to navigate senior year at school, at home, and in the closet, all while grappling with the fact that this \"relationship\" will last only five days. After all, Bryson Keller is popular, good-looking, and straight...right?</p> <p>Drawing on his own experiences, Kevin van Whye delivers an uplifting and poignant coming-out love story inspired by classics like Venio Tachibana and Rihito Takarai's manga <i>Seven Days: Monday-Sunday</i> and the '90s rom-com <i>She's All That</i>. Listeners will root for Kai and Bryson to share their hearts with the world - and with each other.</p>";
