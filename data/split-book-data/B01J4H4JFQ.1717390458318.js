window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Hardcore Self Help: F**k Depression</i> is the follow-up to the best-selling <i>F**K Anxiety</i>. In this book I take the information, tips, and insights that I have gained as a psychologist and translate them into language that doesn't suck. This is the self-help book for people who don't usually like self-help books. </p> <p>In <i>Hardcore Self Help: F**K Depression</i>, I talk to you like a friend. That means I speak directly to you, without psychobabble. Instead I tell you why your brain is such a troll. I explain why you have literally no energy or motivation. I tell you why people are so terrible at offering help. Best of all, I tell you how to take realistic steps toward solving these and many other issues caused by depression. </p>";
