window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sagara Sousuke isn't your typical high school student.</b></p> <p>He reads military enthusiast magazines; he responds to questions with \"affirmative;\" he brings grenades to school in his bag. Though everyone at school takes him for a hopeless military geek, Chidori Kaname thinks there might be something more to him. When their plane is hijacked in the middle of a field trip, Kaname's instincts will prove correct: Sousuke is an elite, mech-piloting mercenary... and he's here to protect her!</p>";
